      "I‚Äôm under the impression that if you have an adhd brain, your brain just works differently. It has different strengths and weaknesses. A lot of people notice adhd symptoms, but as we all know, it can be exacerbated or even show up as a result of social media addiction, poor diet, etc. So if you have bad habits, your goal should be to fix those. If you can‚Äôt even begin to fix bad habits but you‚Äôve given it an honest shot, you most likely need meds as a tool. Medication DOES control symptoms, but some people will have bad symptoms even if they fix habits. This is most likely people with very bad adhd and need higher doses. You won‚Äôt know unless you go through it with a psych and give yourself trial periods.\n",

      "That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm saying because that‚Äôs what‚Äôs backed up by the science - hey, if you can get by without medication more power to you, that‚Äôs great. But the fact of the matter is most folks with adhd cannot consistently manage their lives to a sufficient degree without medication onboard. Adhd is an extremely severe neurobiological disorder and needs to be treated as such. Some folks cannot tolerate medication and some get side effects - however, they are very well tolerated by approximately 80 percent of adhders when taken in therapeutic doses and the drawbacks outweigh the benefits for the vast majority of folks.\n",

      "It is weird to say that it's been only 5 years and a half since those two weeks happened. Now I work for another company, I was recommended by my previous boss, I earn almost 4 times more, I work from home 100% of the time and I love what I do.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Point 2**: I look for friction points. Things that I don't want to do or that are tedious. I automate those as much as I can. I learn constantly about my IDE capabilities and extensions, they usually offer a solution that is almost exactly what  I am looking for. (Autoindent, autorefresh, snippets, keyboard shortcuts, etc). **This is what the 80/20 rule means for me.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Point 3**: I never work more than what I'm paid for. Never. No exceptions. But I never stop working for me. **I have 3 kind of todo lists**: for my job, for my free time... and an \"in between\" list. This last one is the most interesting, because it usually contains tasks that improve my job skills in a way that make my skills as a developer more valuable in general.
